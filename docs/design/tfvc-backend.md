# TFVC Backend

Author: [Isaac Corbrey](mailto:icorbrey@gmail.com)

## Summary

This project attempts to add the ability to use TFVC repositories as the
backend for local Jujutsu repositories. This would make working on legacy
projects stuck in the past a lot more bearable, as well as serving as a proof
of concept for using centralized version control as a Jujutsu backend (outside
of Google's internal tooling).
